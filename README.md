# microG Installer Revived

This is a Magisk module that installs microG GmsCore, GsfProxy and FakeStore (or Play Store if you want so) to `/system/priv-app`.

This is originally based on Hieu Van's microG Installer. Because his repository is deleted, GitHub chose another fork of the main repo as original repo. I archived the original code [here](https://github.com/nift4/microg_installer/tree/23de13101d8dd5807f713d0cace4a565478c6cfd?files=1).

There are two copies of this online: The [Magisk alt module repo](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/microG_Installer) and the [personal](https://github.com/nift4/microg_installer) one. The personal one contains the latest development version and is used for pull requests and issues and the Magisk repo one is the stable code.

Thanks for 100 stars on the personal repo! Remember, if you have any feature reqest, I missed a microG update or it's not working for you, let me know, I'll help/fix/add/update!

## Why you may want to use it

In short: this is the cleanest option to install microG and just be done with it.

UnifiedNlp, which is bundled with GmsCore, if installed as an user app doesn't work on Android 7 and newer without [an additional patch](https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp/blob/master/patches/android_frameworks_base-N.patch). An another solution to the above problem is to install the app as a privileged system app. However, this way is not perfect, due to those kind of apps being wiped after an OTA update. Therefore, I'm creating this module to help simplify the installation of microG with working network-based location.

GsfProxy needs to be an system app for some third-party apps.

Currently, GmsCore 0.2.24, GsfProxy 0.1.0, FakeStore 0.1.0 and MapsV1 0.1.0 are bundled in the module.

**Note**: Install this module before installing any GMS-dependent apps, as well as do not disable it after installing such apps, unless you know what you're doing.

## Installation
- Choose an solution for [Signature spoofing](https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/wiki/Signature-Spoofing)
- If your chosen solution is Xposed-only, [install this apk before the module](https://gitlab.com/Nanolx/NanoDroid/-/raw/master/patcher/dexpatcher/org.spoofing.apk)
- Install the module

## How do I get the real Play Store?

First, if it is broken, it's probably a microG issue. Feel free to report issues in the bugtracker.

Get an Play Store APK (I suggest the [patched Play Store by Nanolx](https://nanolx.org/fdroid/repo/Phonesky_132.apk)). Then put it into `/data/adb/` named `Phonesky.apk`(`/data/adb/Phonesky.apk`). You need to do that only once. If you now install, update or reflash microG Installer Revived there will be an message "Installing real Play Store". This indicates it worked. Now grant all permissions. You can now install updates for the Play Store like for every app.
